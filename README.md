# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Tensorflow-with-Graphical-User-Interface

Graphical User Interface for better user environment purpose ans user friendly
Google Colab: Used to Train the model with ResNet50
Google Colab is used because of high RAM and GPU
Procedure for Training:
Create a folder in Google Drive (Name it accordingly)
Inside the created folder: Create folders naming data and weights(separate folders)
Upload the train and validation datasets into the data folder
The structure Looks like this:
Google Drive:
|_ _ _Breast Cancer Detection(folder)
      |_ _ _data(folder)
      |     |_ _ _train(folder)
      |     |     |_ _ _Images(files)
      |     |_ _ _validation(folder)
      |     |     |_ _ _Images(files)
      |_ _ _Wights(folder)
            | _ _ _(pre-trained weights file if any)
